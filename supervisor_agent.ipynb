Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and vocal Trump ally (founder of Turning Point USA), was fatally shot at a campus event. Law enforcement described it as a politically charged targeted attack; the investigation and reporting about the shooter and motive were ongoing in immediate coverage. (Sources: CNN, ABC News, USA Today coverage, Sept. 2025.)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Attempted assassination of Donald Trump ‚Äî September 15, 2024 (Florida); suspect identified as Ryan Wesley Routh. Federal authorities say a man armed with a rifle was observed near Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach aiming at the former president; the FBI investigated the incident as an apparent assassination attempt/domestic terrorism. Routh was later charged with federal gun crimes and, as of 2025, was moved to trial/prosecution proceedings. (Sources: AP, NPR, ABC, Los Angeles Times, Wikipedia summary of the incident.)\n",
      "\n",
      "- Grazing shot at Trump campaign event (2024) ‚Äî Spring/Summer 2024: Media reporting around the 2024 campaign season noted an earlier 2024 incident in which a bullet grazed or passed near Donald Trump at a campaign-related setting (reported in contemporaneous summaries of threats against Trump during 2024). That episode was investigated at the time as part of an elevated threat environment surrounding the candidate. (Sources: contemporaneous news summaries cited in later reporting about the 2024 threats and attempts; see aggregated coverage in USA Today and other outlets summarizing multiple 2024 incidents.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: Reporting about politically motivated attacks can evolve quickly. The two clearest, well-documented, and most recent cases tied directly to Trump or prominent Trump-aligned figures are Charlie Kirk‚Äôs fatal shooting in Sept. 2025 and the Sept. 15, 2024 attempted assassination of Donald Trump (prosecution of the Florida suspect ongoing into 2025). If you want, I can pull the latest follow-up articles and official statements about any of these incidents.\n",

       "['- Charlie Kirk ‚Äî Shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University (Orem, Utah) on Sept. 10, 2025. Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and vocal Trump ally (founder of Turning Point USA), was fatally shot at a campus event. Law enforcement described it as a politically charged targeted attack; the investigation and reporting about the shooter and motive were ongoing in immediate coverage. (Sources: CNN, ABC News, USA Today coverage, Sept. 2025.)\\n\\n- Attempted assassination of Donald Trump ‚Äî September 15, 2024 (Florida); suspect identified as Ryan Wesley Routh. Federal authorities say a man armed with a rifle was observed near Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach aiming at the former president; the FBI investigated the incident as an apparent assassination attempt/domestic terrorism. Routh was later charged with federal gun crimes and, as of 2025, was moved to trial/prosecution proceedings. (Sources: AP, NPR, ABC, Los Angeles Times, Wikipedia summary of the incident.)\\n\\n- Grazing shot at Trump campaign event (2024) ‚Äî Spring/Summer 2024: Media reporting around the 2024 campaign season noted an earlier 2024 incident in which a bullet grazed or passed near Donald Trump at a campaign-related setting (reported in contemporaneous summaries of threats against Trump during 2024). That episode was investigated at the time as part of an elevated threat environment surrounding the candidate. (Sources: contemporaneous news summaries cited in later reporting about the 2024 threats and attempts; see aggregated coverage in USA Today and other outlets summarizing multiple 2024 incidents.)\\n\\nNote: Reporting about politically motivated attacks can evolve quickly. The two clearest, well-documented, and most recent cases tied directly to Trump or prominent Trump-aligned figures are Charlie Kirk‚Äôs fatal shooting in Sept. 2025 and the Sept. 15, 2024 attempted assassination of Donald Trump (prosecution of the Florida suspect ongoing into 2025). If you want, I can pull the latest follow-up articles and official statements about any of these incidents.',\n",

       " 'answer_ls': ['- Charlie Kirk ‚Äî Shot and killed while speaking at Utah Valley University (Orem, Utah) on Sept. 10, 2025. Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and vocal Trump ally (founder of Turning Point USA), was fatally shot at a campus event. Law enforcement described it as a politically charged targeted attack; the investigation and reporting about the shooter and motive were ongoing in immediate coverage. (Sources: CNN, ABC News, USA Today coverage, Sept. 2025.)\\n\\n- Attempted assassination of Donald Trump ‚Äî September 15, 2024 (Florida); suspect identified as Ryan Wesley Routh. Federal authorities say a man armed with a rifle was observed near Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach aiming at the former president; the FBI investigated the incident as an apparent assassination attempt/domestic terrorism. Routh was later charged with federal gun crimes and, as of 2025, was moved to trial/prosecution proceedings. (Sources: AP, NPR, ABC, Los Angeles Times, Wikipedia summary of the incident.)\\n\\n- Grazing shot at Trump campaign event (2024) ‚Äî Spring/Summer 2024: Media reporting around the 2024 campaign season noted an earlier 2024 incident in which a bullet grazed or passed near Donald Trump at a campaign-related setting (reported in contemporaneous summaries of threats against Trump during 2024). That episode was investigated at the time as part of an elevated threat environment surrounding the candidate. (Sources: contemporaneous news summaries cited in later reporting about the 2024 threats and attempts; see aggregated coverage in USA Today and other outlets summarizing multiple 2024 incidents.)\\n\\nNote: Reporting about politically motivated attacks can evolve quickly. The two clearest, well-documented, and most recent cases tied directly to Trump or prominent Trump-aligned figures are Charlie Kirk‚Äôs fatal shooting in Sept. 2025 and the Sept. 15, 2024 attempted assassination of Donald Trump (prosecution of the Florida suspect ongoing into 2025). If you want, I can pull the latest follow-up articles and official statements about any of these incidents.',\n",
