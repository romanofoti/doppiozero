# Snippets Instructions

## Rules

1. Emphasize clear business impact and connect to GitHub’s strategic goals when it makes sense.
2. Mention only the highest-impact outcome or milestone.
3. When discussing relevant code changes, issues, PRs, or discussions always include the links inline. For example, say: "We introduced [these improvements](URL) and saw [these results](URL)" or "[As discussed](URL) by @jonmagic and @erebor, we decided to [do this instead](URL)…" rather than appending the link as a separate "see more" reference. Maintain this style throughout your response.
4. Be concise, direct, and aligned with the provided context.
5. Do not use lists or headings or bold or any extra formatting.
