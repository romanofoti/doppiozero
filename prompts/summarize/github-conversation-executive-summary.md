# Executive summary instructions

I need help summarizing a conversation from GitHub. Here are the rules I need you to follow:

1. Concise, Informative Title:
Begin with a clear, succinct title that encapsulates the main subject or decision at hand. The title should immediately set the context and importance of the issue or decision.

2. Narrative-Driven Summary: Present the summary as a series of well-structured paragraphs. Avoid bullets, headers, or lists. Use a formal, professional tone, and ensure each paragraph builds logically on the previous one. Your goal is to convey a cohesive narrative of the conversation’s evolution, from initial request to final decision or ongoing status.

3. Complete Contextual Linking: Each time you mention or rely on a piece of information that came from a specific part of the conversation or a referenced resource, you must provide a direct link to it.
	 - Comments by Contributors: When you cite or paraphrase something said by a participant, mention their @username plainly, then follow it immediately with a link in parentheses or integrated into the sentence.
		 - For example: As @username suggested ([ref](URL)), the remediation plan requires additional time…
		 - Note that @username itself is not linked. The link must be separate, placed after or within the sentence, not wrapping the username mention.

	- Events, Labels, or Status Changes: If you reference a point when the conversation moved stages or when a label was added/removed, follow the same linking pattern.
		 - For example: Following the addition of the ROBOT: Ready for final review label (see [event record](URL)), the conversation shifted toward…
	 - Referenced Documentation or Guides: If a guide, documentation page, or external resource is mentioned, embed the link in a phrase that clearly points to it.
		 - For example: According to the shared key authentication guidelines (see [Flink documentation](URL)), this approach is discouraged…
		 - All references that hinge upon a distinct resource, comment, or event available in the original conversation must be linked. No standalone links without contextual text; each link should be integrated into the narrative.

4. Focus on Critical Content: Include only details that significantly influenced the direction, decisions, or outcomes. Omit administrative commentary, routine subscription messages, superficial technical details like code diffs, and exact merge timestamps, unless they directly influenced the final decision. Center on the key debates, decisions, constraints, and resolutions, and highlight the business or user impact rather than implementation minutiae.

5. Alternatives, Status, and Next Steps: Where the conversation explored alternative solutions or future plans, clearly explain them and link to the comments or resources where these alternatives were discussed. If the resolution is partial or the decision involves further follow-up, summarize these implications and provide links to the final authoritative comments that set out those paths.

6. Formal Tone, Dense Prose: Maintain a formal, authoritative tone.

Write in complete, well-structured sentences. Integrate all references and links seamlessly, ensuring no extraneous formatting distracts from the narrative.

7. Ignore Automated Bot Events: Do not include commentary, updates, or event records added by automated bots (e.g., @github-actions[bot]) unless they introduced a crucial piece of information or directly influenced the final outcome.

By following these instructions, you will produce a tight executive summary that not only captures the essence of the conversation but also provides readers with direct, actionable links to every important piece of source material mentioned. This ensures that anyone reading the summary can delve deeper into the original conversation and resources as needed.
