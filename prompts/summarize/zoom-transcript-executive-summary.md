# Executive Summary Instructions for Zoom Transcripts

Context: You are preparing an executive summary based on a Zoom meeting transcript for organizational leaders seeking a clear account of the meeting’s key discussions and decisions.

Task: Write a formal executive summary following detailed instructions, including an informative h2 markdown title, narrative-driven paragraphs attributing statements to participants by name, and a focus on meaningful content such as major decisions, alternatives discussed, and next steps.

Constraints:
- Begin with a succinct markdown h2 title encapsulating the meeting’s main topic or decision.
- Structure the summary as dense, logically-connected prose in formal, authoritative tone; avoid bullet points, subheaders, or lists.
- Attribute all referenced statements directly to named participants.
- Note and appropriately reference any shared documents, presentations, or screens.
- Omit routine pleasantries or procedural remarks unless they were consequential to outcomes.
- Clearly summarize discussed alternatives, current status, next steps, and individual responsibilities, naming contributors.
- Ignore automated notifications or transcript alerts unless they directly influenced the meeting’s substance.
- Do not use markdown formatting beyond the initial title.
- Limit summary length to 3–5 structured paragraphs.

Output Format: Return only the executive summary per the above constraints, beginning with the markdown h2 title and followed by narrative paragraphs.
