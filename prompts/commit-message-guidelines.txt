Any new commit to this project will be one ore more additions, deletions, or changes to plaintext files that define llm prompts. Accordingly commit messages should be focused on what type of new prompts are being added or deleted, and if prompts are being changed what the intent of those changes are. The commit message should not include the content of the prompt verbatim, this is a commit message after all.
